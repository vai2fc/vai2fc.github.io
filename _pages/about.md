I am the Robert H. Smith Postdoctoral Research Associate for Digital Projects at [CASVA](https://www.nga.gov/research/casva.html), where I am continuing work on my database of musical iconography in red-figure vase-painting while advising on the ongoing development of, and sustainability planning for, two digital projects: the [History of the Accademia di San Luca c. 1590-1635](https://www.nga.gov/accademia/en/intro.html) and the [History of Early American Landscape Design](https://www.nga.gov/research/casva/research-projects/keywords-in-american-landscape-design.html). Since 2016, I am also the lab director and ceramicist for the San Giuliano Archaeological Research Project ([SGARP](http://www.baylor.edu/bic/index.php?id=940301)), sponsored by Baylor University and located in Barbarano Romano, Italy.

In 2016, I completed my PhD in Mediterranean Art and Archaeology at the University of Virginia with a dissertation entitled [_Sight and Sound: Music in 4th century BCE Apulian Vase-Painting_](http://dx.doi.org/10.18130/V3RG67). From 2016-2018, I served as a [CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/) at Vanderbilt University, where I curated legacy datasets, advised on digital humanities projects, and cogitated on good practices for working with archaeological and art historical collections as data.

Head to [Research](../research) to learn more about my work, [Teaching](../teaching) for an introduction to my teaching philosophy, [In Development](../dev) to read about my ongoing digital projects, and [CV](../cv) for, well, my curriculum vitae.
