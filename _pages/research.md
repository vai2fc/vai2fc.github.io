My research is structured around three inter-related themes: pottery, artefacts-as-data, and longevity.

### Pottery
[My dissertation](http://dx.doi.org/10.18130/V3RG67) focused on the representation of music and musicians in South Italian red-figure vase-painting of the 4th century BCE. My current book project (working title: _The Italiote Kithara: Music, Performance, and Iconography in South Italy and Sicily_) builds on my previous research to examine the interaction of performative and visual culture throughout Magna Graecia during the same time period. By integrating visual evidence for music and musicians, archaeological evidence for musical instruments, and literary evidence for the region's vibrant performance culture, the book and accompanying digital database will examine questions of visual culture audiences, identity politics, and the performative landscape of South Italy and Sicily in the 4th century BCE.

As ceramicist and lab director for the San Giuliano Archaeological Research Project ([SGARP](http://www.baylor.edu/bic/index.php?id=940301)), I also work with archaeological ceramics from Etruscan tombs (c. 6th century BCE) and a Mediaeval fortification (c. 10th-13th century CE) in northern Lazio, Italy. The project, initiated in [summer 2016](http://www.fastionline.org/excavation/micro_view.php?fst_cd=AIAC_958&curcol=sea_cd-AIAC_8754) by Baylor University, investigates the _longue dur√©e_ history of the site. Publications and presentations about our results are forthcoming.

### Artefacts-as-Data
With research interests straddling archaeological (quantitative) and art historical (qualitative) approaches to ancient Greek pottery, I am methodologically oriented towards executing multi-scaled analyses of archaeological artefacts. While the potential of computer vision technology for archaeological and art historical research is thrilling, I am also interested in how the act of turning artefacts into traditionally-computable (i.e. textual) data impacts our understanding of our primary source materials, as well as how the format of the data may drive our research questions and conclusions. Some preliminary musings on the topic are available [here](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/semantic-web/blob/gh-pages/posts/2017-01-09.md).

### Longevity
Having worked with legacy archaeological data for most of my career, I am interested in understanding and, to whatever extent it is possible, future-proofing research data. Beyond the concerns of file formats and hardware stability, I am interested in how to make research data truly (re)usable and expandable by future users wo are 10, 20, 50, or 100+ years away. Whether as a consultant on a digital humanities project or a collaborator on an archaeological excavation, I advocate for data wills. Data wills build upon robust data management plans to explain to future users the full context of the data collection, retention, and publication policies utilized throughout the project and facilitate knowledge building as an iterative, multi-generational pursuit. I presented a few preliminary thoughts on the idea of data wills (in the context of a legacy data curation project) at the [International Data Curation Conference 2017](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/IDCC17~/presentations/VAI-CBA_IDCC17_presentation.pdf).
